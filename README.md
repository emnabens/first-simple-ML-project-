This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning notebook that focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnoses using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as either malignant or benign based on key features extracted from breast mass cell images.
The notebook compares the performance of different classification models to determine which one works best for breast cancer diagnosis prediction.
Dataset: Uses the built-in load_breast_cancer() dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Data Preprocessing: Includes data exploration, visualization, feature scaling, and train-test splitting.
